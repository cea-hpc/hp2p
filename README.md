# HP2P

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cea-hpc/hp2p.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cea-hpc/hp2p)

**HP2P** (Heavy Peer To Peer) benchmark is a test which performs MPI Point-to-Point non-blocking communications between all MPI processes. Its goal is to measure the bandwidths and the latencies in a situation where the network is loaded. The benchmark can help to detect problems in a network like contentions or problems with switchs or links.

The benchmark comes with a interactive GUI tool written in Python 2 with Matplotlib for post-processing the result.

This branch is only for bug correction.

New: HTML report can be generated instead of Python GUI for portability. The following link gives an example of a report.

## Prerequisites

Main program:

* C++ compiler
* MPI

Visualization:

* Python 2.x.x
* Python plugins:
 * Numpy
 * Matplotlib
 * mpldatacursor

## Getting started

```
$ ./configure --prefix=<path-to-install>
$ make
$ make install
```
The program **hp2p.exe** is generated.

## Running HP2P

```
$ hp2p.exe -h
 Usage: ./hp2p.exe [-h] [-n nit] [-k freq] [-m nb_msg]
        [-s msg_size] [-o output] [-r hostfile]
        [-b bin_timer] [-i conf_file]
 Options:
    -i conf_file    Configuration file
    -n nit          Number of iterations
    -k freq         Iterations between snapshot
    -s msg_size     Message size
    -m nb_msg       Number of msg per comm
    -b bin_timer    Generate Bin timer (false = 0 (default), true = 1)
    -t max_time     Max duration
    -c build        Algorithm to build couple (random = 0 (default), mirroring shift = 1)
    -r hostfile     Hostfile
    -o output       Output file
```
The program is written in MPI:
```
 $ mpirun -n 32 ./hp2p.exe -n 1000 -s 1024 -m 10 -b 1 -o first_test
```
This command will launch the benchmark on 32 MPI processes and will run 1000 iterations. An iteration consists on a draw of random couples of MPI processes and then a phase where 10 successive communications of 1024 bytes will be performed.
The benchmark aims to test the network, so it is better to launch the benchmark with 1 MPI process per node.
At the end of the execution, a *hostfile.txt* file and files prefixed with *first_test* are created.

## Visualization
### Matplotlib GUI 
```
$ vizhp2p -H hostfile.txt first_test
```
### Plotly HTML
```
$ ./vizhp2p_html -H hostfile.txt -c "Unamed cluster" -o first_test.html first_test.bin
```
